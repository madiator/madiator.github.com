            <ul>
              <li>Regenerating codes specially designed for data centers are being implemented over Hadoop HDFS</li>
              <li>Based on Facebook's implementation of HDFS-RAID</li>              
              <li>About 2x reduction in network utilization and disk I/O during file repairs.</li>              
              <li>Advised by Prof. Alex Dimakis.</li>
              <li>Source code available at <a href="https://github.com/madiator/HadoopUSC">https://github.com/madiator/HadoopUSC</a></li>
              <li>Appeared in <b>VLDB 2013</b>. </li>

            <h3 class="simpleheading simpleheadingcolored">Network Coding for Vehicular Networks</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> Network Coding applied to Vehicular Networks to minimize the delay in content retrieval.</li>
              <li>Obtained theoretical upper bounds on delay and showed regions where Network Coding performs better than naive distribution strategy.
              </li>              
              <li>Simulated on real taxi traces to show the improvement.</li>
              <li>Continued the work at General Motors to test on real vehicles. </li>
              <li>Advised by Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari, Prof. Alex Dimakis and Dr. Fan Bai. </li>              
              <li>Appeared in Infocom-Mini 2012 and journal submission under progress. </li>

            <ul>
              <li>A Java based simulator primarily designed to study coded and uncoded content distribution strategies in vehicular networks.</li>
              <li>The goal is to simulate a city-wide network of vehicles exchanging content with one another. </li>
              <li>Advised by Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari in collaboration with General Motors R&D</li>

            <h3 class="simpleheading simpleheadingcolored">Twitter Retweet Dynamics <small>Apr 2010 -- Aug 2011</small></h3>
            <ul> 
               <li>Using data collected from Twitter, we showed an interesting trend between the number of retweets received and the probability of retweeting by Twitter users.</li>
               <li>Work was presented at the <i>2nd Annual Annenberg Symposium</i> and was invited to present again at the <i>3rd Annual Annenberg Reception</i>.</li>
               <li>Future work involves characterization of Tweets based on their space-time properties, spam detection in Twitter etc. </li>

              <ul>
              <li> Implemented MapReduce (a framework for distributed processing) on USC's High-Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) cluster consisting of thousands of nodes, as part of a course. </li>
              <li> Used it to study huge network datasets. </li>
