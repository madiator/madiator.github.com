## Who am I?
I am Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, but go by Mahesh Sathiamoorthy. I am a Software Engineer at Google since 2014 and work on ML/Recommender Systems/TPUs (since 2017).

From 2008 to 2013, I was a PhD student at Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California. I worked with Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachariand Prof. Alex Dimakis. My thesis was titled "Optimizing distributed storage in cloud environments".

Before that, I did my B.Tech(H) in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India, from 2004 to 2008.

## What is this site about?
Apart from serving as my home page, I will be writing about or showcasing:
* [Technology (tutorials, commentary)](/tech), because I am a technologist at the core of what I do.
* Photography and art (coming someday!).
* and of course [miscellaneous articles, in the form of blogs](/blog).

## Smarter.blog
The human mind is fascinating. A monkey may look at the sky and see some stars. But when human look at the sky, we not just see stars, but decipher our place in the universe and peer into the past.
We make things, we communicate, we reason, and we argue. The human mind is capable of endless surprises. But at the same time, we fail, often in predicable ways.
For all these reasons, the human mind is very fascinating to me. 

I tend to write about the mind at [smarter.blog](http://smarter.blog).
