## What is this site about?
The human mind is fascinating. A moneky may look at the sky and see some stars. But when human look at the sky, we not just see stars, but decipher our place in the universe and peer into the past.
We make things, we communicate, we reason, and we argue. The human mind is capable of endless surprises. But at the same time, we fail, often in predicable ways.
For all these reasons, the human mind is very fascinating to me. I would like to write as much as possible about such topics, and more, structured as below:

* [About cognition, our mind, sharpening it with mental models, cognitive biases etc.](/mind-over-matter).
* [Technology (tutorials, commentary)](/tech), because I am a technologist at the core of what I do.
* Photography and art (coming someday!).
* and of course [miscellaneous articles, in the form of blogs](/blog).

## Who am I?
I am Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, but go by Mahesh Sathiamoorthy. I am a Software Engineer at Google since 2014 and work on ML/Recommender Systems/TPUs (since 2017).
I try to read as many books as possible, a lot of them being audiobooks. And as you may have guessed from the above list, and as is fashionable these days somehow, I love Photography (and consider myself an artist, though that is debatable; let's talk about that on a different day).

From 2008 to 2013, I was a PhD student at Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California. I worked with Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachariand Prof. Alex Dimakis. My thesis was titled "Optimizing distributed storage in cloud environments".

Before that, I did my B.Tech(H) in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India, from 2004 to 2008.
