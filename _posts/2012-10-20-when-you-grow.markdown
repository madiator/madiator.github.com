This is my view and opinion of how personal growth occurs. Your's may differ.

You are constantly in struggle with yourself, and may be you are unhappy (in a healthy way). You are always thinking of what you want to be, what you need to learn, what you have to do etc. You identify your weakness and you either know how to fix them and go ahead or you are fighting to figure out things. You try to be ahead of your peers. These are the endeavors that will make you grow. May be you will end up in a more competitive place filled with even more people smarter than the new you. As you continue to identify your weakness and keep working on it, you will keep growing.

And I think once a person becomes content with who he is, growth stops  (there will be some growth, but slow).

I also stumbled upon this, which I seems to reflect what I think:

{% blockquote Lucy Liu, TV Producer %}
When you're a highly motivated and ambitious person, you usually rise to the top and you get used being a star. Wherever you go, you come out smelling like a rose. But suddenly you get to a certain level and you look around and there are people who are twice as ambitious as you, twice as smart, twice as experienced. And you either die and shrivel away, or you can say, "Now I have to compete at another level. I'm just going to kick it up a notch."
{% endblockquote %}

(stumbled upon this when browsing the preview of the book "Never Check Email in the Morning: And Other Unexpected Strategies for Making Your Work Life Work").
