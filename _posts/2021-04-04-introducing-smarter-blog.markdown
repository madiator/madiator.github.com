I started a new blog called [smarter.blog](http://smarter.blog) at the beginning of the year.

I have always been fascinated with the human mind and have wanted to write about it.
In fact, I rearranged this website towards the end of 2020 to consist of
three sections: "mind over matter" where I write about the mind, tech and the blog. 

But after thinking over a bit more, I decided that
I will keep this domain just about myself and to write about tech when possible and to shift the content
of mind over matter into its own domain.

So, over at smarter.blog, I will be writing all sorts of [articles about the human mind, how to improve your craft, how to avoid stupidity etc](http://smarter.blog). The site is still in early stages. As a token of encouragement, please sign up over there to get updates. :)
