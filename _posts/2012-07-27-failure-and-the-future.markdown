Failures can be debilitating. You got badly injured while skiing and now you do not want to skii again. Your past venture into a startup was a failure and you are scared of starting anything new again. I really wanted to share an 
excerpt from a book called Sleight of Mouth, that essentially blew my mind off:

> My grandfather taught me how to drive. He told me that I could drive safely looking only in the rear view mirror, providing the road ahead is exactly the same as the road behind. 

So do you assume that the road in front of you is going to be the same as the one before?
