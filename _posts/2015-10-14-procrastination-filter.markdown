Have you ever noticed drowning into a sea of articles that you opened via Hacker News? Did you end up buying those nine little things from Amazon of which you don't use any?  If you think you didn't, then the very fact that you are reading this article means you have been goofing around the Internet.

But if you do feel swamped by those 40 tabs on chrome, then I highly urge you to apply this Procrastination Filter to cure your internet inflicted ADD brain. The trick is simple. When you come upon an 'interesting' link, tell yourself that you will open it later. Procrastinate it. Chances are that you will forget it, but if it was something important you wouldn't. So the very act of procrastination acts like a filter separating the gold from the mud. Note that you will not come last in the race if you failed to constantly keep yourself updated (its a rat race anyways). 

Alright, jokes aside, try this next time when you are planning to buy something online: procrastinate.
