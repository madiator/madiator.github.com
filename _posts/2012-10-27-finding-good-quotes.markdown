I am not talking about the traditional quotes from Leo Tolstoy or say Einstein. I am talking about quotes and hidden nuggets of wisdom in recent books that are not yet mainstream. Everybody knows about the fish and the tree story, so why not do something different? This is where crowdsourcing comes into picture - let others tell you what quotes are good. 

So head over the [Amazon kindle most highlighted books of all time](https://kindle.amazon.com/most_popular/books_by_popular_highlights_all_time/1#15), and you can spot a lot of good quotes. You can also click on the books to find more. 

So here you go:

{% blockquote, Dale Carnegie, How to win friends and influence people %}
Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a personâ€™s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.
{% endblockquote %}
