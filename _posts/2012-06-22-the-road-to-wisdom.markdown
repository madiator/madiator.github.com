[Piet Hein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hein_(Denmark\)) puts it tersely:

> The road to wisdom? Well it's plain 
and simple to express:
Err
and err
and err again
but less
and less
and less.
- Piet Hein, Poet

And yes, I have had my share of mistakes. Only time will tell if I am on the correct road!
