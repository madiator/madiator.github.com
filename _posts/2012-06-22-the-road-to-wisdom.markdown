Piet Hein, a Danish polymath, who is famous for his short poems (also known as gruks or grooks) puts it tersely:

> The road to wisdom? Well it's plain \
and simple to express: \
Err \
and err \
and err again \
but less \
and less \
and less.
- Piet Hein, Poet

And yes, I have had my share of mistakes. Only time will tell if I am on the correct road!
