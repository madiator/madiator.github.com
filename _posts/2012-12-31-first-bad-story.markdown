I ended up writing a short story. 
Irrespective of how good it is, I decided to post it. Oh by the way, happy new year!
The challenge was to come up with something to describe the following image:

### Chapter 1: Skyfall

It is very hot and I am sweating profusely. I am exhausted and want to give up. I am struggling to stand on the top of a mountain, blanketed by lush green grass. The sky is blue and the clouds are moving rapidly. The sea is not visible, but I know the mountain is just an island buffeted by waves on all the sides. I am surrounded by a number of people, and all of them are pulling me apart, literally. There is Kenneth in one direction, my parents in another, a few friends and a few unknown strangers. They are all standing around me and are pulling me towards them with a rope. And then there is uncle Ben standing outside the group, looking elsewhere into the horizon. Everybody is looking at me, and I am looking at uncle Ben. He is in his coat and hat, and is carrying his walking stick as usual. I don't see his face, but I know he is calm.
As I continue to struggle the pull, things change around me. All of a sudden, the sky turns grey, the grass dries up rapidly and the land turns red like lava. Before I figure it out, the land below me plummets, the ropes disappear, and we are all under water. In a blink, they are all gone and in the moments of silence that follow, I too disappear into the water. I wake up from the dream coughing for breath.


I have lost count of the number of times I have had the dream. Every single time, I wake up with a splitting headache. The clock tells me that the time is 4am. The air I breath is stale, and the coffee I just made tastes stale. Everything is dim and lifeless. I am barely living.

### Chapter 2: Earthly Drama

Global warming was not a thing of imagination anymore. It was for real. Nobody denied it. It was there, staring at us. Like a lion before it was about to jump on its prey. Most places were hot like a furnace, except a handful across the world, like Hirazaki, where we got to stay. Hirazaki, I was told, was in erstwhile Japan, which was under water now. I must say that being part of a family of entrepreneuring civil engineers was a good thing. 

I didn't know whom to hate --- the human beings who brought this fate to themselves or mother nature who had the crazy defense mechanisms to protect herself. About a decade ago, in the spring of 2029, my uncle's friend who was researching in the Antartica gave use the grim news. He told us that beneath the hidden layers of ice and glaciers that were miles thick, was a large pool of pristine water untouched and unaffected for many million years. In it were microbes that had not seen day or light. I distinctly remember, even as a child, how what he said next had shocked us all. He said that in ten years when all the icecaps melted, this pool of microbes would become exposed and that since neither we humans nor anything alive had seen anything like it for millions of years, our immune systems would not be able to cope. He said that these microbes that he had smuggled into his lab had killed everything they came in contact with.
This summer was warmer than before, which was warmer than the previous year. And it marked the tenth year anniversary of the death of my uncle Ben's friend who had given us the news. It was said that he died in an accident in his lab, though nobody knows for sure what happened. 


### Chapter 3: Lifeless

I was told by my late parents that uncle Ben was a billionaire in the 2020s. They told me how the world had changed a lot in the 2030s, how the rich and a few came to dominate the world. They told me that there were 20 billion people in the 20s and a billion in the 30s. I could not fathom the number one billion. What would a world look like with a billion lives and a billion stories? Imagining even a million souls was difficult. There were a million people left, I hear; I must have seen a hundred of them, all my life. 
After my parents had passed away, uncle Ben started protecting my brother Kenneth and me. There were no schools, no science, no innovation, no nothing. We all knew our time was limited.
I was in a constant state of panic all the time. I kept having bad dreams that ended up in splitting headaches. I was extremely weak for a twenty year old male. All I wanted was some inner peace. 
I didn’t get to see Kenneth much, because he was busy helping uncle Ben. It was not about money, anymore. 
The only friends I had were books. But the more I read history, the more I came to know about the past of the beautiful world, and the more I depressed I became. I didn’t want to die, I didn’t want anybody else to die.


### Chapter 4: Ben's Calm

![Picture Description](http://photos.smahesh.com/photos/i-rchh5Tt/0/O/i-rchh5Tt.jpg)

Uncle Ben was a man with a plan. He had studied civil engineering and made his fortune making mountains. Yes, making mountains. As the sea-levels began to rise, most of the land had submerged and the rich people that didn’t want to move to an entirely unknown nation, wanted to make mountains and stay. Since everything was under water now, not many people knew how to convert the loose sand into a sturdy mountain. This is where uncle Ben made his riches. 
Everybody knew that this was a temporary solution, but they did it. Uncle Ben himself knew this wouldn’t work, but he did it anyway. 

### Chapter 5: Nirvana

Today’s dream was particularly vivid and strong. As I was walking aimlessly, sipping the stale coffee early in the morning, I stumbled upon a book. 
In many respects, the book was similar to me. It was sitting all alone by itself. The pages were fragile and the moribund book---I was afraid---might give up and fall out of my hands anytime soon. I took it to my study, placed it on my table, and wisked away the dust gently while trying to make sure the pages wouldn’t fly away. 
After four hours of embarking on a journey that would change my life, I flipped the last page of the book and closed it. I came to know of this person called Buddha and his teachings. I closed my eyes. Everything started to make sense now.

I have been misinterpreting my dream all this time. The people around me were not pulling me apart. It was me who was pulling them all towards myself, it was me who didn’t want to let go of them. I didn’t want to die and I didn’t want to let anybody else die. I had desires and expectations. And the earth was not listening to me. The world is just a small dot in the grand scheme of things and there was nothing I could do to change its course. As human beings, we all could have stopped this, but we didn’t. We didn’t have to hurt the earth. We brought it upon ourselves, and there was nothing I could do now. I just have to accept it and face it. I have to let go of my desires, expectations and every little thing. I have to let go. Uncle Ben must have understood this, that is why he was outside the group, that is why he always kept his calm.
Like a miracle, my headache vanished. I found my peace. I achieved nirvana. I don’t think I need this diary any more.
