## Once upon a time
About ten years ago, when I was in high school (gasp, is it already ten years?), I used to have a little note book of *crazy ideas*. I would jot down random ideas that would come to my mind. Most of them were some kind of product ideas and almost all were crazy and some beyond stupid; or didn't make much sense financially. Others were pretty good (well, according to me yes!). One of them goes as follows - make soaps and toothpastes so that they foam a lot towards the end. When the customer has to buy a new one, he will remember to buy this product because of its foamy awesomeness.
I still don't know whether the *Crazy idea 23* is a simply too good or just plain unethical.

The point of this post is two-fold: 

> - It is important to write down your ideas.
> - Your brain loves high throughput work.

## Other Samplers
Few other product ideas that I had in mind were very similar to "Google Chrome" and "Priority Inbox" much before the world knew about them. Yes, you heard that right and I am not just making this up. I will post more details about them later. Another one I had, was that of a virtual currency system that you can earn by being popular on the web, and you can use it to buy things/services off the Internet.  I will one day post the list of crazy ideas I have had. 

Eventually, I graduated to using Microsoft's OneNote, mostly because it looked quite neat and I could throw in ideas without worrying about saving or formatting. Also, having them as OneNote pages in a notebook tab allowed me to access other ideas very fast. I don't use OneNote anymore, but have those files tucked away somewhere in my Dropbox. 

## Why you got to jot it down
It is very important to jot down the crazy ideas you get, even if they are completely ridiculous or frivolous. One of the reasons is that after you have a thousand bad ones, you will stumble into a good one. But that is not so much as the reason for emphasis here. What I think is more important is that it helps expand your mind. The next time you come across something very relevant to one of your ideas, you will be able to process it, relate to what you had and possibly be able to refine your previous idea.

## The brain loves pressure
One of the things that I noticed was that I would keep getting tons of ideas only when I was preparing for my exams. I realized that when my brain is working hard, it is willing to do more work. Most of the other time, irrespective of whether I was doing something useful or not, I wouldn't come up with anything good. I figured out it is all about efficiency. More recently, every time there is a deadline, I cook more ideas. And most of them go in vain after the deadline. Its like runner's high. Your brain likes it when you run, rather than just walk. 


## Love that deadline
So thats right folks, keep your brain under pressure and you will rolling out soon with ideas. I have started out using Pomodoro technique and it is definitely improving my productivity if not creativity.
