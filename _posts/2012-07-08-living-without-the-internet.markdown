### Death without the Net
At first it seemed excruciatingly painful, if not impossible. How was I supposed to work at home if there is no internet? How would I respond to mails? What am I supposed to do without Internet? A wave of questions swept me when I first learnt that the Internet connection at the new place where I moved in will be activated one week after the move in. One damned week. Yes, thats seven days that also includes a weekend. How was I supposed to live?

### Well, not really..
I am not strictly off the Internet. I have access to the full glory of the Internet at USC (work). At home, I can always use my iPhone (on a 300 MB plan which I am careful not to max out). Additionally (thanks to Google), I have a (free) [Chromebook](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/) with 3G (up to 100MB free and I am determined to not pay for additional data). So I have been able to check mails and sometimes reply to a few. So during the first few days without the Internet, it dawned upon my realization that it wasn’t as bad as I had imagined. Also I have the option of walking to the nearby Starbucks. 

### The Good
As days passed, I started feeling calmer. I started realizing that I was in fact sick all this time due to the Internet, not physically but mentally. It was like I was doing a detox. It was like the hookworms were being washed away. Clearly the Internet had dominated my life, if not consumed it (of course, I was not chained to the Internet, but I realized that I had been spending the bulk of my time unorganized). If a thought came to me, say about a product or an idea, I would go check it out *immediately*. As soon as I thought of the last status message I had put on Facebook, I would *immediately* open Facebook and check for comments/likes. And a few times when doing work, I would get distracted and would browse through a series of websites before realizing that I was off the track. If I was bored for an instant, Hacker News would be on. 

### Realization
As soon as I cut it off, I realized that I had been succumbing to instant gratification. I realized that it wasn’t too tough to live without Internet. I could still do a hundred things on my laptop without the Internet. I could read books on the Kindle app (or even a real book), do most of my research (which involved Matlab, Latex and Eclipse most of the time). And I could write undisturbed.

### Treat it with respect
The Internet is an asset, has a wealth of information and is extremely useful for research and other productive endeavors. But it in fact a giant spider spewing cobweb and you can get stuck easily if you don't treat it with respect.

### Lessons

1. You will not die without the Internet. You can live with limited supply of it. That way you start planning how to use the Internet, and start respecting it.
 
2. Let go off the instant gratification. Postpone it to a later time. Chances are that you will eventually forget about that cat video that you wanted to see but will remember to check what matters. Time shifting is like a filter to remove the unnecessary weed. 

3. You will soon start shifting from consuming to producing, which is without a doubt a good thing. 


Unfortunately, I will get the Internet in a few days but I strongly hope that I do not go back to the bad old days. I am planning to keep most of the Internet consumption on the phone and Chromebook and disable the Internet on the macbook. At the end of the day, I will be happy if I am able to treat the Internet with respect and strike off things on my ToDo list.

Keep blowing your mind.
